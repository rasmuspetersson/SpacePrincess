# SpacePrincess
A simple 3D flying game made with Unity engine.

## Gameplay 

A princess trapped in space with one mission, to save her warrior friends far away in the galaxy! 
It's a pretty simple 3D game where you steer a rocket ship through space, the controls are a little bit sloppy but works okay.  
The goal is to land on the green "helicopter pad" and you are of to the next level. Currently there is only two levels and sadly some of the lightning effects are gone due to the compression to WebGL. 
If you are finding yourself in a tough situation you can always press 'R' to start over.
